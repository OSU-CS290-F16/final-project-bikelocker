An overview of the client interface, including the different pages a user can navigate to within the app (if there are multiple pages), the major UI components on each page, and the main interactions possible on each page.  Sketches (even photographs of napkin sketches) are helpful here but are not required.

Client interface: I was thinking of creating a web app for posting and searching for stolen bicycles. A web app where if your bike is stolen, you can create a post of the bikes information and appearance, like serial number, model, and even a picture. The pages that you would navigate between would be like a login to create an account to save you bikes info, a ‘surf stolen bikes’ page to see what bikes have been reported stolen around you, and perhaps a ‘check if a bike is stolen’ where you would enter information of a bike you are in the process of purchasing to make sure it isn’t stolen.
This data would be stored and surfed, so we need modals to enter data and search engines to see it.






An overview of what data will be stored on the back end along with a description of how this data will be used by the client.  You don’t need to worry about the details of how this tata will be organized or stored.


Data storage: I think the data stored would consist of texts and numbers representing bike information like model, brand, year, physical descriptions. The data stored could also be images like a picture of the bike itself or the similar bike from an online marketplace. This data would be implemented by the client and surfed by the client.
